# SiameseNetwork
A one-shot learning siamese twin network for face recognition.
This network is currently still under construction. In its current form, it uses a simple conv layer + fully connected layer standard layout. As a result, the robustness to change in point of view and intensity may not be optimal.
The current form network can be trained using MIT licensed face dataset.
In the meantime, I am going to implement LSTM and attention module for better robustness and learning the correlation between examples in the dataset.
Stay tunned!
